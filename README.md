# Learning Deep Learning with Analogies 🧠

Ever felt overwhelmed by Machine Learning jargon? We get it! This course explains Deep Learning concepts using simple analogies and practical code examples using PyTorch.

## Why This Course? 🤔

Learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning can be tough. While there are many great resources out there, we believe the best way to learn is through:
- Simple analogies that relate to everyday life
- Clear explanations of why we do what we do
- Hands-on coding examples
- No complicated math (just the essential concepts)

## What Makes This Course Different? 💡

- **Everything explained with analogies**: Complex topics broken down using real-world examples
- **Beginner-friendly**: No prior ML/DL knowledge needed
- **Learn by doing**: Practical code examples and exercises
- **AI-assisted learning**: Recommended use of AI chat tools (like Perplexity) when stuck

## Prerequisites 📚

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Ability to run Python code (locally or using cloud platforms like Google Colab)
- Curiosity to learn!

## Course Content 📖 (Needs to be updated once the notebooks are finished)

### Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Linear Regression: Your First ML Model
- Gradient Descent: How Models Learn
- Normal Equations: A Different Approach

### Deep Learning Journey
- PyTorch Basics: Your New ML Friend
- Neural Networks: Building Blocks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Image Processing Magic
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Understanding Sequences

## How to Use This Course 🎯

1. Start with the fundamentals
2. Read the analogies and explanations
3. Try the code examples
4. Practice with exercises
5. Use AI chat when stuck
6. Create issues if something's unclear
