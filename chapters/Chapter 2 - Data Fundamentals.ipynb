    "## Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like a boring topic, but it's important to understand the different types of data that we will be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Numerical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Numbers**\n",
    "Think of continuous data like measuring temperature - it can be any value: 98.6°F, 98.7°F, or even 98.65°F. Other examples include:\n",
    "- Height (5.7 feet, 5.8 feet)\n",
    "- Weight (150.5 pounds)\n",
    "- House prices ($299,999.99)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Numbers**\n",
    "These are counting numbers that can't be broken down further. Imagine:\n",
    "- Number of pets in a house\n",
    "- Students in a classroom\n",
    "- Cars in a parking lot\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nominal Categories**\n",
    "Think of these as labels with no order, like:\n",
    "- Colors (Red, Blue, Green)\n",
    "- Car brands (Toyota, Honda, Ford)\n",
    "- Cities (New York, London, Tokyo)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Categories**\n",
    "These are categories with a natural order, such as:\n",
    "- T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL)\n",
    "- Movie ratings (1 to 5 stars)\n",
    "- Education levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Binary Data  \n",
    "This type of data has only two possible values, often represented as 0 and 1. Examples include:\n",
    "- Yes/No questions (e.g., Is the light on? Yes or No)\n",
    "- Gender (Male or Female)\n",
    "- Pass/Fail results in exams\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is data that changes over time, like:\n",
    "- Daily stock prices\n",
    "- Monthly temperature readings\n",
    "- Weekly sales figures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Words and sentences that carry meaning, such as:\n",
    "- Customer reviews\n",
    "- Email content\n",
    "- Social media posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Understanding data types helps us choose the right tools and techniques for our machine learning models. Just like you wouldn't use a hammer to cut paper, each data type needs its own special handling!"
